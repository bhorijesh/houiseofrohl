It is devoid of ornate details and has monochromatic tendencies. Modern decor elements usually have specific purposes and functions. The modern design concept is one of balance, minimalism, and is linear, though not always angled. And yet, architectural and geometric elements are often present in this style, and while the aesthetics are minimal and uncluttered, modern style is the epitome of sophistication and elegance.
