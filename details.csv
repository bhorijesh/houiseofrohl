In many cases, twice the industry standard for thickness. The benefit is luster and richness of a true decorative product. Your ROHL lavatory faucets will deliver years of beauty with normal care and maintenance.', 'ROHL MODERN DESIGN\nDefining Modern faucets, fixtures, hardware and accessories is complex due to the many expressions called ""modern"". For example, the term can refer to art movements in the past or the style\'s interior design roots in Scandinavia. But regardless of expression, modern design often is simple and sleek. It is devoid of ornate details and has monochromatic tendencies. Modern decor elements usually have specific purposes and functions. The modern design concept is one of balance, minimalism, and is linear, though not always angled. And yet, architectural and geometric elements are often present in this style, and while the aesthetics are minimal and uncluttered, modern style is the epitome of sophistication and elegance. Modern style is timeless.', 'ROHL UNLACQUERED BRASS FINISH\nROHL Unlacquered Brass Finish is bright and regal. It has a brilliant shine and is best described as the gold used on fine band instruments. It conveys the experience of luxury through a distinctively soft, warm and genuine feel in comparison to other products made with synthetic coatings. Unlacquered Brass Finish is a ""living finish"" in that the character of the finish will develop and change over time depending on its use and maintenance. Therefore, our standard limited lifetime warranty does not apply to this finish. To maintain this finish, it is recommended to use mild soap and water. Do not scrub or wipe the surface or use cleansers that contain abrasive or corrosive elements like ammonia. Do not rub or buff. Our finishes are created to deliver years of resilient beauty with normal care and maintenance.']",https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-80sqzb3h0c/images/stencil/600x600/products/114317/107137/gowmp8w2eqnqi5yfketi__52197.1652156898.jpg?c=1,"{'Room': 'BATH', 'Warranty': 'NO EXPRESS WARRANTY', 'Product Type': 'BATHROOM FAUCET', 'Style': 'MODERN', 'Hole Configuration': '3', 'Mounting Location': 'DECK', 'Installation Type': 'WIDESPREAD', 'Shape': 'C-SPOUT'}"
